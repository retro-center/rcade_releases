R-Cade has been developed specifically for optimal compatibility with Rockchip hardware manufactured by our partners.

In order to make R-Cade legal to distribute, the version of the software that's included on the hardware purchased from retro-center will need a network connection in order to be fully featured. After acknowledging a usage license, R-Cade will download and install an upgrade to it's fully featured version. Until that upgrade is performed, R-Cade is limited to media, music, pictures, KODI, and a lightweight web browser. This is done to avoid any licensing and legal concerns regarding shipping a product with video game emulators.

If you already own compatible hardware, you are welcome to download and use official releases of R-Cade without any purchase necessary, but you do still have to agree to the software use license.
